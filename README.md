# CalendarDesign

Design a calendar service that can create events for users.

Mandatory Requirements:

Users can enter their shift timings (working hours) or create busy slots. Itâ€™s possible for users to have more than one shift in a day.

Users can fetch events of themselves and other users.

Users can create events with other users for a defined start time and end time and delete events created by themselves.

Organizer of an event can fetch the most favorable upcoming empty slot for a given set of users and a particular duration.
For instance user A would like to check the favorable slot with user B, user C to set an event of 4 hours duration. This would require user A to check the upcoming events in his/her calendar as well as for user B, user C.

Users can fetch events where they have conflicts for themselves for a particular day.


**Bonus Extensions:
**

Organizers can have the capability to create recurring events in future for a specific number of times. Recurring events will have the exact same start and end time of day with the same set of users.
